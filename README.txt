To run, download the entire project from GitHub. You will need to install the PyBrain library and all of its dependencies. Details on doing so can be found http://pybrain.org/docs/quickstart/installation.html. Additionally, you will need to be running python 3.

You will need to start the server before you will be able to see the visualization. To start the server type
    python server.py
into your terminal when in the top-level of the Air-Elasticity-Demand directory.

Navigate in your browser of choice to http://localhost:8001/visualization/index.html
It will take a few seconds for the visualization to load initially and then you will be greeted with a drop down menu and three sliders above a graph of the continental United States. To use the tool, select an airport. The tool will update dynamically as you change sliders or the airport. In the case of larger airports, it may take a few seconds for the bubbles to appear on the map.
